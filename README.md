# Rock Paper Scissors
## An Excellent Hand Game

<p>
Rock is designated by maintaining the fist, Scissors by extending the middle and index fingers, and Paper by holding the hand out flat. If players throw out the same gesture, the game goes on. If not, it's decided by a harmonic and intransitive method â€” rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, but paper covers rock
